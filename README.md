#Module 19 Crypto Clustering 


 By using the StandardScaler - I created a data frame with the scaled data and Clustered Cryptocurrencies with K-means by the Scaled Data frame using the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the scaled Data frame.
Also, by predicting the clusters that grouped the cryptocurrencies using the scaled data frame. I created a copy of the scaled data frame and added new columns and predicted the clusters. Then optimizing the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis project utilizing python and supervised learning skills to predict if the market changes.
